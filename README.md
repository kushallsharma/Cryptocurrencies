# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview 

The project is to ascertain grouping for different cryptocurrencies which are present in trading market. Available data needs to be cleaned and processed to fit machine learning model using python. To keep the model cost effective, reducing dimensions is required to be employed and perform clustering of the data using K-Means (un-supervised machine learning) model. Finally, clustered data need to be visualized in table, 2D and 3D graph as required. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to classify cryptocurrencies getting traded in the market 

## Results
