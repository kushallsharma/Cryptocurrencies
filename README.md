# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview 

The project is to ascertain grouping for different cryptocurrencies which are present on trading market in the given data. The data needs to be cleaned and processed to fit machine learning models. Using python, it is required to pre-process the data to make it appropriate for the unsupervised machine learning model. To keep the model cost effective, reducing dimensions is also need to be employed and finally perform clustering of the data. The clustered data need to be visualized in table, 2D and 3D graph as required. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to classify cryptocurrencies getting traded in the market 

## Results
